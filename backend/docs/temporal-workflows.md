# Temporal Workflow Design Patterns

## 1. Workflow Composition

Break complex workflows into smaller, reusable child workflows. Use workflow orchestration to coordinate multiple sub-workflows for configuration fetching, content processing, and email delivery. This enables better fault isolation and reusability.

**Key Principles:**
- Each workflow has a single, clear responsibility
- Child workflows can be tested independently
- Parent workflows orchestrate child workflow execution
- Enables parallel execution of independent workflows
- Better fault isolation and recovery

**Benefits:**
- Improved maintainability
- Reusable workflow components
- Better testing granularity
- Clearer workflow visualization in Temporal UI

## 2. Activity Design Rules

Activities are the building blocks of workflows. They represent external interactions and should follow these principles:

### Idempotent
Safe to retry without side effects. Activities should produce the same result when called multiple times with the same input.

**Implementation Guidelines:**
- Check state before making changes
- Use unique identifiers for operations
- Design APIs to be naturally idempotent
- Handle duplicate operations gracefully

### Deterministic
Same input produces same output. Activities should not have random behavior or depend on external state that can change between retries.

**Implementation Guidelines:**
- Avoid random number generation
- Use consistent timestamp sources
- No side effects that persist across retries
- Predictable error handling

### Single Responsibility
One clear purpose per activity. Each activity should do one thing well.

**Implementation Guidelines:**
- Name activities clearly after their purpose
- Keep activities focused and small
- Avoid mixing concerns (e.g., fetch and process)
- Compose complex operations from multiple activities

### Timeout Aware
Always set appropriate timeouts for different activity types.

**Timeout Categories:**
- **Fast operations** (< 5s): Database queries, cache lookups
- **Medium operations** (5-30s): Single HTTP requests with retries
- **Long operations** (30s-5m): Content processing, AI operations
- **Very long operations** (> 5m): Batch processing, large data transfers

## 3. Error Handling Strategies

Temporal provides powerful error handling and retry mechanisms. Design workflows to leverage these capabilities.

### Retry Policies with Exponential Backoff
Implement proper retry policies for transient failures.

**Configuration:**
- **Initial interval**: Start with 1-5 seconds
- **Backoff coefficient**: 2.0 for exponential growth
- **Maximum interval**: Cap at 60 seconds
- **Maximum attempts**: 3-5 for most operations
- **Non-retryable errors**: Configure errors that should not retry

### Fallback Processing
Design workflows to gracefully degrade rather than completely fail.

**Strategies:**
- **Partial results**: Process successful sources even if some fail
- **Default values**: Use sensible defaults when data unavailable
- **Skip and continue**: Log failures but continue workflow
- **Notification**: Alert on partial failures while still delivering

### Graceful Degradation
Ensure digest delivery even with reduced content.

**Implementation:**
- Always deliver digest unless catastrophic failure
- Include partial content with clear indicators
- Prioritize successful sources
- Include error summary for failed sources
- Maintain delivery schedule consistency

## Workflow Examples

### Daily Digest Workflow
Main workflow orchestrating the entire digest generation process.

**Steps:**
1. Fetch user configuration and preferences
2. Fetch content from all sources in parallel
3. Process content (similarity detection, topic extraction)
4. Generate summaries and personalize
5. Assemble digest email
6. Send with retry logic
7. Update delivery status

**Error Handling:**
- Individual source failures don't block workflow
- Content processing errors fall back to raw content
- Email delivery has independent retry policy
- All steps log detailed progress

### User Onboarding Workflow
Validates user configuration and sources during signup.

**Steps:**
1. Validate email format and domain
2. Validate all configured sources
3. Send verification email
4. Wait for email confirmation (with timeout)
5. Activate user account

**Error Handling:**
- Source validation failures provide specific feedback
- Email delivery failures trigger re-send
- Timeout on verification triggers reminder
- Failed validation prevents activation

### Source Validation Workflow
Lightweight availability checks for content sources.

**Steps:**
1. Fetch source URL with timeout
2. Validate response format
3. Parse sample content
4. Update validation status
5. Store validation timestamp

**Error Handling:**
- Network errors mark source as temporarily unavailable
- Parse errors mark source as invalid
- Timeout errors trigger later retry
- Success updates last validated timestamp
