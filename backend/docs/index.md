## Quick Navigation

- When touching anything under `app/processors/`, start with the matching doc in `docs/processors/`.
- Workflow changes (Temporal activities/workflows) must cross-check both `temporal-workflows.md` and the processor contract they invoke.
- Configuration additions belong in `configuration.md` **and** note the dependency in the relevant processor doc.
