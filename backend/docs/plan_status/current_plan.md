  - Article model enhanced with ai_topics field for storing extracted topics
  - Content truncation to 1000 characters for efficient token usage
  - Comprehensive test suite (15 tests) with mock AI provider
- ✅ **Content normalization** (`normalizer.py`) - **COMPLETED** - Business-level validation and metadata standardization for consistent article quality
  - Content validation (minimum length, non-empty, whitespace handling)
  - AI-powered spam detection with confidence scoring and reasoning
  - Date normalization ensuring UTC-aware datetime handling
  - Metadata standardization (title, author, tags, URL cleanup)
  - Tracking parameter removal and HTTPS upgrade
  - Smart content truncation at word boundaries
  - Graceful error handling with fallback behavior
  - Comprehensive test suite (30 tests) with mock AI provider
- **Text processing utilities** (`utils/text_processing.py`) for content cleaning and extraction (planned)

*Note: Basic content cleaning and text normalization is already implemented in RSS fetcher*

### 3. AI Integration Layer (Building on Provider Abstraction)
- ✅ **Quality scorer** (`quality_scorer.py`) - **COMPLETED** - Hybrid quality assessment combining rule-based metadata scoring with AI-powered content quality analysis
  - Rule-based metadata scoring (0-50 points): author, date, tags, content length
  - AI-powered content quality assessment (0-50 points): writing quality, informativeness, credibility
  - Structured output with ContentQualityResult Pydantic model
  - Configurable quality scoring toggle via QUALITY_SCORING_ENABLED setting
  - Graceful degradation to metadata-only scoring when AI disabled
  - Quality scores stored in article.metadata for ranking and filtering
  - Comprehensive test suite (4 tests) with mock AI provider
- ✅ **PydanticAI summarizer** with configurable summary styles (brief, detailed, bullet points) - will use AI provider abstraction
- ✅ **Relevance scorer** using keyword matching and semantic analysis against interest profiles - will use AI provider abstraction
- **Content classifier** for categorizing articles by topic/type

### 4. Temporal Workflow Implementation (`app/temporal/`)
- **Workflow definitions** (`workflows/digest.py`) for daily digest generation with parallel content fetching
- **Activity implementations** (`activities/`) for content fetching, processing, and email delivery
- **Worker configuration** (`worker.py`) and client setup (`client.py`)
- **Error handling and retry policies** for robust workflow execution

### 5. Service Layer Enhancements (`app/services/`)
- **Content service** (`content.py`) for orchestrating the processing pipeline
- **Enhanced user service** (`users.py`) with source management and interest profile handling
- **Digest service** (`digest.py`) for coordinating workflow execution and delivery

### 6. Configuration and Dependencies
- **Add RSS-specific settings** to `config.py` (fetch timeouts, retry policies, cache TTLs)
- **Environment variables** for PydanticAI API keys and Temporal configuration
- **Redis cache integration** for content caching and similarity analysis results

### 7. Database Schema Updates
- **Add content tracking tables** for processed articles and similarity groupings
- **Enhance ContentSource model** with validation status and metadata
- **Create workflow execution logs** for monitoring and debugging

### 8. API Enhancements
- **Source validation endpoints** for real-time URL checking
- **Content preview endpoints** for testing feed processing
- **Workflow monitoring endpoints** for digest status tracking

### 9. Testing Strategy
- ✅ **RSS Feed Fetching Tests** - Complete test suite with 73 passing tests covering HTTP client, URL validation, RSS parsing, factory pattern, and error handling
- ✅ **AI Provider & Similarity Tests** - Complete test suite with 22 passing tests using mock AI provider for deterministic results, including topic aggregation from grouped articles
- ✅ **Topic Extraction Tests** - Complete test suite with 15 passing tests covering topic extraction, error handling, content validation, max topics enforcement, and content truncation
- ✅ **Content Normalization Tests** - Complete test suite with 30 passing tests covering content validation, spam detection, date normalization, metadata standardization, and URL cleanup
- ✅ **Quality Scoring Tests** - Complete test suite with 4 passing tests covering hybrid scoring, metadata scoring, AI quality assessment, and graceful degradation
- ✅ **Cache & Utility Tests** - Test suite with 23 passing tests for Redis caching and utility functions
- ✅ **Integration & Edge Case Tests** - 19 passing tests for integration scenarios and edge cases
- ✅ **Total Processor Tests** - **170 comprehensive tests** across all content processing components
- ✅ **Unit tests** for remaining AI processors (summarization, relevance scoring) - planned
- **Integration tests** for end-to-end content processing pipeline - planned
- **Temporal workflow tests** using the Temporal testing framework - planned
- **Mock external services** for reliable testing - implemented for AI providers

## Key Technical Decisions
- **Parallel processing**: Use Temporal activities for concurrent RSS fetching
- **Caching strategy**: 24-hour TTL for processed content, caching for similarity analysis results
- **Similarity detection**: AI-powered semantic analysis using configurable AI providers to group related articles rather than remove duplicates
- **Topic aggregation**: Topics extracted per-article are merged across all articles in similarity groups for comprehensive categorization
- **Error handling**: Graceful degradation with partial results rather than complete failure
- **Scalability**: Repository pattern with async database operations
- **AI provider abstraction**: Protocol-based design for easy switching between AI models (Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) via configuration

## Dependencies & External Services
- RSS feeds via HTTP requests with proper User-Agent and rate limiting
- PydanticAI with configurable AI providers (Google Gemini by default, OpenAI planned) for topic extraction, similarity detection, and summarization
- Redis for caching and session management
- Temporal server for workflow orchestration
